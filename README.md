# NonlinearSystemNumericalSolver
This repository contains a python module called `NumericalSolver` for solving 2nd-order nonlinear systems numerically by implementing different algorithms.

# Contents Summary
This project has been conducted in two pahses.


## Phase 01: NonSingular Systems
Solves non-singular 2nd-order systems numerically using one of the following algorithms:
* Euler
* Adams-Moulton 2nd-order
* Adams-Moulton 4th-order
* Runge-Kutta 2nd-order
* Runge-Kutta 4th-order
* Predictor-Correcotr
* Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order


## Phase 02: Singular Systems
To be Updated... :D



# How to use
## Install dependencies
Try running the following line in your command prompt to install required packages for the module to run.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples
See the example scripts to find out about how the module works. Try running the examples for better grasp. Also, for your convenience, it is recommended to study the given examples in the `.ipynb` rather then `.py` files.
